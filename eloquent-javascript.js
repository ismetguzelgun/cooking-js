//Strings are unicode

//Backtick-quoted strings, usually called template literals
//`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`

//There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is NaN (“not a number”).
console.log(NaN == NaN)
// → false
/*NaN is supposed to denote the result of a nonsensical computation, and as such, 
it isn’t equal to the result of any other nonsensical computations.*/

/*The difference in meaning between undefined and null is an accident of JavaScript’s design, 
and it doesn’t matter most of the time. In cases where you actually have to concern yourself with these values, 
I recommend treating them as mostly interchangeable.*/
