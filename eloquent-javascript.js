//Strings are unicode

//Backtick-quoted strings, usually called template literals
//`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`

//There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is NaN (“not a number”).
console.log(NaN == NaN)
// → false
/*NaN is supposed to denote the result of a nonsensical computation, and as such, 
it isn’t equal to the result of any other nonsensical computations.*/
